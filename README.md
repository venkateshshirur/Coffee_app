SQLite is an open-source relational database i.e. used to perform database 
operations on android devices such as storing, manipulating or retrieving 
persistent data from the database.
It is embedded in android bydefault. So, there is no need to perform any 
database setup or administration task.Here, we are going to see the example of 
sqlite to store and fetch the data. Data is displayed in the logcat. For displaying 
data on the spinner or listview, move to the next page.
SQLiteOpenHelper class provides the functionality to use the SQLite database.
